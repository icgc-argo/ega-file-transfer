         <STUDY_TITLE>Genome-wide mutation analysis of germinal-center B-cell derived lymphomas within the ICGC MMML-Seq Consortium</STUDY_TITLE>
         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>Germinal-center B-cell derived lymphomas (GCB-lymphomas) are the most common B-cell lymphomas in children and adults, with Burkitt Lymphomas (BL) predominating in childhood and follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) predominating in older age groups. The cell-of-origin in all these lymphomas is supposed to be a germinal center B-cell and transformation of FL in DLBCL or intermediate DLBCL/BL (intL) can occur. In the framework of the German ICGC MMML-Seq we are currently exploring sequencing data of GCB-lymphomas and paired normal controls as well as normal B-cell subsets separated by FACS. This includes whole genome, transcriptome, miRNAome and whole methylome datasets.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
