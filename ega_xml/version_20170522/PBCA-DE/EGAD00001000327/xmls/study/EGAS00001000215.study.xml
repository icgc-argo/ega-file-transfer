         <STUDY_TITLE>ICGC PedBrain: Deep-sequencing of childhood brain tumors.</STUDY_TITLE>
         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>Brain tumors constitute the childhood tumors with the highest mortality rates and survival is often associated with severe long-term sequelae due to intensive multimodal treatment regimens. Thus, the PedBrainTumor network aims at the identification of robust biomarkers for clinical management and novel molecular targets for therapeutic interventions. Using massively parallel whole-genome sequencing, and transcriptome and methylome sequencing for subsets of cases, we aim to decipher the molecular causes of medulloblastoma as well as low-grade astrocytoma, and to identify markers to stratify patients for specialized treatment. As the PedBrain network is affiliated with clinical trials in medulloblastoma and pilocytic astrocytoma, validation cohorts for the translation of key findings into clinical settings are readily available.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
