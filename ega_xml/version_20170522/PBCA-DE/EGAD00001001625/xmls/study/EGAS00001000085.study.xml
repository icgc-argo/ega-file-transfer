         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>Brain tumors are the second most common pediatric cancer and carry the highest mortality rates in this age group. 
	Medulloblastoma is the most frequent malignant brain tumor of childhood. 
	Recent studies indicate that medulloblastoma comprises at least four sub-entities (SHH-signaling, WNT-signaling, Group-C, Group-D) that differ in molecular alterations, cell of origin, clinicopathological features and outcome. 
	Further characterization of the entire spectrum of genomic alterations underlying the formation of these distinct groups is urgently needed to identify diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for clinical management and uncover novel therapeutic targets.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
