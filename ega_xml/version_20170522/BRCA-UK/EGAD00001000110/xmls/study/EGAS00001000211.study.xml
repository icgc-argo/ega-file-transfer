         <STUDY_DESCRIPTION>Agilent whole exome hybridisation capture will be performed on genomic DNA derived from 100 breast cancers of all subtypes and matched normal DNA from the same patients. Three lanes of Illumina GA sequencing will be performed on the resulting 200 exome libraries and mapped to build 37 of the human reference genome to facilitate the identification of novel cancer genes.</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>

         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>Cancer is driven by mutation. Using Agilent exome hybridisation capture and Illumina GA massively parallel sequencing technology, we aim to sequence ~1600 microRNAs plus the protein coding genome of 100 matched human breast cancer samples. Bespoke algorithms are being developed to identify the somatically acquired point mutations, insertions and deletions in these samples. This project will give unprecedented insights into mutational processes, cellular repair pathways and gene networks associated with breast cancer development.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
