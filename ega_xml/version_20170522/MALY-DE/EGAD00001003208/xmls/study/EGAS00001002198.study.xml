         <STUDY_TITLE>The genomic landscape of Burkitt Lymphoma</STUDY_TITLE>
         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>As part of the ICGC, the ICGC MMML-Seq project performed whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing of Burkitt Lymphomas . Burkitt lymphomas are the most common B-cell lymphomas in childhood. Analyses were performed in concordance with the guidelines of the ICGC. The results define the genomic landscape of structural variants, somatic single nucleotide variants and mutational signatures in these lymphomas.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
