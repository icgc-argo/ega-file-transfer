         <STUDY_DESCRIPTION>These samples are from locally advanced breast cancers that have been treated with epirubicin monotherapy before surgery. We will sequence some samples from patients with good response to the therapy and some with poor response to the therapy.</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>

         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>All cancers arise due to somatically acquired mutations in their genomes which alter the function of key cancer genes. Understanding the critical mutational events underlying the development of cancer is paramount for advancing prevention, early detection and effective treatment of the disease. Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death among women. Extraordinary recent advances in sequencing now make it a realistic aim to sequence large numbers of breast cancer genomes to find somatic mutations on a massive scale.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
