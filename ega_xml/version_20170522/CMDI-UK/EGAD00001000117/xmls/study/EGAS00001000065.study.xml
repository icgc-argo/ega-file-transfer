         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>We propose to begin sequencing whole genomes from population CD samples in mid 2011, to be ramped up in the first year of the QQ. The aim is to identiy low frequency and rare variation which contributes to CD risk but is not easily detectable by GWAS. Thes sequences will be compared to UK10K and Cambridge BioResource controls.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
