         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>Cancer is driven by mutation. Illumina GA massively parallel sequencing technology will be applied to Agilent exome hybridisation capture libraries and total genomic paired-end libraries. Bespoke algorithms are being developed to identify the somatically acquired structural variants, point mutations, insertions and deletions in these samples. This project will give unprecedented insights into mutational processes, cellular repair pathways and gene networks associated with Myelodysplastic Syndrome development.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
