         <STUDY_TITLE>Epigenomic and Genomic Correlates of Aggression in Curable Prostate Cancer</STUDY_TITLE>
         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>We analysed 200 whole-genome sequences and 477 whole-exome sequences – supplemented with analysis of RNA expression and global DNA methylation from a subset of cases – of tumours from men with localized, non-indolent prostate cancer, to develop multimodal (DNA, RNA, epigenomic) biomarkers of disease aggression and treatment failure in this cohort. These tumours, which possess similar pre-clinical risk profiles and represent the vast majority of cases on initial clinical presentation, have a paucity of clinically-actionable SNVs, in distinct contrast to that reported for mCRPC. Conversely, a significant proportion of tumours harbour recurrent non-coding aberrations, large-scale genomic rearrangements, and a novel mechanism of PTEN inactivation whereby a local inversion represses transcription of genes within its boundaries. Local hypermutation events (kataegis and chromothripsis) were frequently observed, and associated with specific genomic profiles and with aggressive disease and patient outcome. Importantly, several molecular aberrations were prognostic for disease recurrence. Most striking of these were several DNA methylation events, which outperformed well-described prognostic biomarkers like MYC amplification, NKX3-1 and PTEN deletion, and percentage genome alteration. Our data suggest that novel therapeutic approaches should focus on recurrent targets in localized prostate cancer to improve cures in aggressive localized disease.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
