         <STUDY_TITLE>Whole genome sequencing of Japanese HCCs</STUDY_TITLE>
         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>To determine somatic mutation profiles and substitution signatures in Japanese HCC, we performed whole genome sequencing of 31 HCCs with various epidemiological backgrounds. Somatic mutations and rearrangements were determined as previously reported. The data will be deposited to the ICGC database and is used for further comparative and integrative analyses.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
