         <STUDY_DESCRIPTION>We propose to definitively characterise the somatic genetics of Metastatic breast cancer through generation of comprehensive catalogues of somatic mutations in Metastatic breast cancer cases by high coverage genome sequencing coupled with integrated transcriptomic and methylation analyses.</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>

         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>All cancers arise due to somatically acquired mutations in their genomes which alter the function of key cancer genes. Understanding the critical mutational events underlying the development of cancer is paramount for advancing prevention, early detection and effective treatment of the disease. Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death among women. Extraordinary recent advances in sequencing now make it a realistic aim to sequence large numbers of breast cancer genomes to find somatic mutations on a massive scale.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
