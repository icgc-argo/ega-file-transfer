         <STUDY_TITLE>Genome-wide identification of distinct miRNA-mRNA target regulation pairs in Non-Hodgkin lymphomas: a report from the ICGC MMML-Seq consortium</STUDY_TITLE>
         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>We obtained miRNA profiles by miRnome sequencing from ICGC MMML-Seq patients diagnosed with Burkitt lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma and provide evidence of subtype-specific miRNA expression differences. We describe differentially expressed, mutated, edited and not previously annotated miRNAs.
Addditionally, by performing argonaute-2 photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) experiments, we obtained a set of biochemically-validated miRNA binding sites and  identified miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs with a negative correlation in patient RNASeq data.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
