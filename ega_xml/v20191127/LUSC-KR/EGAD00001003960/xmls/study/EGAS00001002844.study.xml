         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>Purpose Lung squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) is the second most prevalent type of lung cancer. Currently, no targeted-therapeutics are approved for treatment of this cancer, largely due to lack of systematic understanding of the molecular parthenogenesis of the disease. To identify therapeutic targets and comparatively analyze them in lung SqCC, we probed somatic alterations of Korean lung SqCC.  Patients and Methods We performed massively parallel whole-exome sequencing of 104 Korean lung SqCC patients’ samples with matched normal samples. In addition, copy number analysis and transcriptome analysis were conducted for a subset of these samples. Clinical association with cancer-specific somatic alterations was investigated.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
