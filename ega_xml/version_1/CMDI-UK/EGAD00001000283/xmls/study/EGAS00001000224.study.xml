         <STUDY_DESCRIPTION>Agilent whole exome hybridisation capture was performed on genomic DNA derived from MDS and matched normal DNA from the same patients. Next Generation sequencing performed on the resulting exome libraries and mapped to build 37 of the human reference genome to facilitate the identification of novel cancer genes. Now we aim to discover the prevalence of our findings using bespoke pulldown methods and sequencing the products from a larger set of patient DNA.</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>

         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>All cancers arise due to somatically acquired mutations in their genomes which alter the function of key cancer genes. Understanding the critical mutational events underlying the development of cancer is paramount for advancing prevention, early detection and effective treatment of the disease. Extraordinary recent advances in sequencing now make it a realistic aim to sequence large numbers of cancer genomes to find somatic mutations on a massive scale.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
