         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>In order to investigate the full range of genetic alterations contributing to the tumourigenesis of low-grade astrocytoma, we have conducted a next-generation sequencing-based analysis on a large series of matched tumor-normal pairs. This study, conducted by the International Cancer Genome Consortium PedBrain Tumor Project (ICGC PedBrain, http://www.pedbraintumor.org/), has revealed multiple new insights into the biological basis of this tumor entity.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
