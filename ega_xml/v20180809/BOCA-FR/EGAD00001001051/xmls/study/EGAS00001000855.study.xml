         <STUDY_TITLE>Genomic landscape of Ewing sarcoma (ICGC project)</STUDY_TITLE>
         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>The Ewing sarcoma project aims to sequence 100 complete genomes of cells of patients suffering from this disease. It is an initiative of great projection, since this is the second most common bone tumor in children and teenagers. The goal of the project is to establish the catalogue of somatic mutations that may cooperate with EWS-ETS fusion in the development of the tumor. 
The Ewing sarcoma project aims to perform 100 whole genome sequencing of germline and tumor DNA as well as at least 50 RNA-seq from tumors. Correlations between molecular profiles and clinical features will be established. The mutated genes will be further validated in a series of 500 Ewing sarcoma cases from our Tumor Bank.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
