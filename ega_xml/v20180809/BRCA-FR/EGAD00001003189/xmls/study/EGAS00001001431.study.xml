         <STUDY_TITLE>Breast Cancer - Subtype defined by an amplification of the HER2 gene</STUDY_TITLE>
         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>Clinically positive HER2 (cHER2+) breast cancers (BC) are defined by the amplification and overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2/ERBB2) gene on chromosome region 17q12 and represent 15% of all BCs. Although anti-HER2 targeted therapies have improved BC’s natural history, the magnitude of their benefit varies widely between patients and deciphering the genomic heterogeneity of cHER2+ BC may provide a basis to better understand patients’ outcome. As part of the ICGC Breast Cancer Working Group effort, we combined whole genome sequencing and transcriptomic analyses of 64 cHER2+ primary invasive carcinomas.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
