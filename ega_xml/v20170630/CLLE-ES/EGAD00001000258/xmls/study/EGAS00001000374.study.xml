         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a B-cell neoplasm with a heterogeneous clinical and biological behavior.  We have performed deep RNA sequencing in different subpopulations of B-lymphocytes from healthy individuals and CLL cells from a cohort of 98 patients, and characterized the CLL transcriptional landscape with unprecedented resolution. The transcriptomic architecture of CLL uncovered here refines the biological characterization of the disease and opens new perspectives for the clinical management of patients.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
