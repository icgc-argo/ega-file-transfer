         <STUDY_TITLE>Breast Cancer - Very young women</STUDY_TITLE>
         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>This project will focus on sequencing of breast cancer from young age cancer patients characterized by age at diagnosis under 35. Based on the incidence rate by Korean National Cancer Incidence Database, breast cancer is the most common solid tumors among young adults aged 15-34 excepting thyroid cancer (Cancer statistics in Korea (2012)). This project just started from the mid of 2015. National cancer center in Korea are collecting more than 100 tumor specimens from breast cancer patients aged 20-34. Genetic features of young patients will be investigated with somatic mutation pattern, structural variations, and canonical pathways.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
