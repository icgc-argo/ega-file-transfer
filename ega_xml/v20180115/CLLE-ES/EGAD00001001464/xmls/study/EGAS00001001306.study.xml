         <STUDY_TITLE>Integrated Genomic Analysis of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia</STUDY_TITLE>
         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a frequent and heterogeneous disease whose genetic alterations determining the clinicobiological behaviour are not fully understood. Here, we describe a comprehensive evaluation of the genomic landscape of 452 CLLs and 54 monoclonal B-lymphocytosis (MBL), a precursor disorder.  This study provides an integrated portrait of the genomic landscape of CLL, identifies new recurrent mutations acting as drivers of the disease, and suggests clinical interventions which may improve the management of patients with this neoplasia.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
