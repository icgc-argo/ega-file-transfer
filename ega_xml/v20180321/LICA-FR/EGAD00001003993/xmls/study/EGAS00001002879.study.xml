         <STUDY_TITLE>RNA-seq of Liver Cancer</STUDY_TITLE>
         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>The French ICGC project on liver tumors is coordinated by Pr Jessica Zucman-Rossi and funded by Inca (French Institute for Cancer). The aim of the present project is to identify the catalog of somatic and germline mutations in liver tumors using whole genome (WGS) and whole exome sequencing (WGS), integrated with DNA methylation and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. The present series corresponds to 161 RNA-seq samples from tumors with matched WES or WGS. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for more than 90% of liver cancers, and is a major health problem. It is the 3rd cause of cancer-related mortality. Advances in genomic analyses have formed a comprehensive understanding of different underlying pathobiological layers resulting in hepatocarcinogenesis. Thus, the development of next-generation sequencing technologies has made it possible to generate more comprehensive catalogues of somatic alteration events (single nucleotide substitutions, structural variations, and epigenetic changes) in liver cancer genome than ever before.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
