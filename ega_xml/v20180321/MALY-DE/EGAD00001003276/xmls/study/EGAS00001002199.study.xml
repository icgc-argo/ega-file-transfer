         <STUDY_TITLE>The genomic landscape of follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma</STUDY_TITLE>
         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>As part of the ICGC, the ICGC MMML-Seq project performed whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing of follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas are the most common B-cell lymphomas in adulthood. Analyses were performed in concordance with the guidelines of the ICGC. The results define the genomic landscape of structural variants, somatic single nucleotide variants and mutational signatures in these lymphomas</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
