         <STUDY_DESCRIPTION>Genomic libraries (500 bps) will be generated from  total genomic DNA derived from a range of cancer samples and subjected paired end sequencing on the llumina GA. Paired reads will be mapped to build 37 of the human reference genome to facilitate the generation of genome wide copy number information, and the identification of novel rearranged cancer genes and gene fusions.</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>

         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>Cancer is driven by mutation. Illumina GA massively parallel sequencing technology will be applied to Agilent exome hybridisation capture libraries and total genomic paired-end libraries from a range of cancer samples. Bespoke algorithms are being developed to identify the somatically acquired structural variants, point mutations, insertions and deletions in these samples. This project will give unprecedented insights into mutational processes, cellular repair pathways and gene networks associated with  cancer development.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
