         <STUDY_TITLE>Comprehensive investigation of genome architecture of gastric adenocarcinoma with whole-genome sequencing in the Chinese population.</STUDY_TITLE>
         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>In this study, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 214 paired GC tumors and adjacent normal tissues to identify novel potential biomarkers. We extracted mutational signatures which induce somatic mutations and classified GC tumors into four groups with significantly different prognosis. Moreover, we observed copy number changes and structural variations frequently occurring in some cancer related genes. Our study covers a comprehensive genetic framework that can be used in clinical trials and treatment modalities in GC.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
