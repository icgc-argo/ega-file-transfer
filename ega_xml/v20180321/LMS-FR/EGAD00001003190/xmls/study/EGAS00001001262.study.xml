         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) are an uncommon group of malignant mesenchymal tumors composed of cells showing distinct smooth muscle differentiation. These tumors occur mainly in adults in any location of the body (soft-tissue, viscera or uterine). Soft-tissue LMS represent 10-15% of all soft-tissue sarcomas. The most frequent locations are the limbs followed by the retroperitoneum and uterine.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
