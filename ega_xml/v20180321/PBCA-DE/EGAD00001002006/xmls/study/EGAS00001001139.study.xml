         <STUDY_TITLE>Whole genome and RNA sequencing of paediatric glioblastoma in the ICGC PedBrain project</STUDY_TITLE>
         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>Paediatric glioblastoma (pedGBM) is characterised by substantial intertumoural heterogeneity. In order to identify the genetic lesions underlying tumourigenesis, we analysed whole genomes and transcriptomes of pedGBMs and in vitro model systems by next generation sequencing. Novel fusions of the receptor tyrosine kinase MET lead us to investigate targeted therapy using MET inhibitors. This study is part of the International Cancer Genome Consortium PedBrain Tumor Project (ICGC PedBrain, http://www.pedbraintumor.org/).</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
