      <TITLE>Whole Genome, RNA, and ChIP Sequencing of matched brain tumor-normal pairs (ICGC)</TITLE>
      <DESCRIPTION>Whole Genome Seq: Illumina HiSeq sequence data (with >30x coverage) were aligned to the hg19 human reference genome assembly using BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009); duplicate reads were removed from the final BAM file. No realignment or recalibration was performed. Paired-end RNA sequencing reads were mapped to the hg19 assembly of the human reference genome using BWA. Each ChIP-seq library was sequenced with two complete lanes on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 in the 101-bases paired-end rapid mode and aligned to hg19 using bwa. This resulted in the following coverage values (genome-wide, after deduplication, including all uniquely mapping reads): GBM103::  macroH2A1: 17x, H3K36me3: 20x; MB59::  macroH2A1: 11x,  H3K36me3: 11x</DESCRIPTION>
