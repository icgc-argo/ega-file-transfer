         <STUDY_TITLE>Hypermutation of the inactive X chromosome is a frequent event in cancer</STUDY_TITLE>
         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>Mutation is a fundamental process in tumorigenesis. However the degree to which the rate of somatic mutation varies across the human genome and the mechanistic basis underlying this variation remain to be fully elucidated. As part of the ICGC PedBrain and Malignant Lymphoma (MMML-Seq) consortium we performed a cross-cancer comparison of whole genomes comprising a diverse set of childhood and adult tumors including both solid and hematopoietic malignancies. In addition we performed whole genome sequencing of clonally expanded hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from healthy individuals to compare somatic mutation rates.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
