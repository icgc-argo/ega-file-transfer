         <STUDY_TITLE>ICGC Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma (pilot) - To deeply sequence tumour and normal genomic DNA (including the precursor condition Barretts esophagus when material is available) to provide a comprehensive catalogue of somatic mutations.</STUDY_TITLE>
         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>The esophageal project will focus on adenocarcinoma which is increasing in incidence in the UK and other developed countries and has a very poor outcome. The primary aims of this project are to deeply sequence tumour and normal genomic DNA (including the precursor condition Barretts esophagus when material is available) to provide a comprehensive catalogue of somatic mutations. This will be achieved through a UK-wide network of hospitals involved in a research collaboration called the OCCAMS consortium. The goal of this project is to use high quality clinical material with accurately annotated clinic-pathological, treatment and outcome data.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
