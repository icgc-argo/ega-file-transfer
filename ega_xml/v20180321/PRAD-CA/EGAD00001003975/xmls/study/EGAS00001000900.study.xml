         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>Over 5 years, CPC-GENE will sequence the genomes of 350 intermediate risk prostate cancers to identify genetic signatures that differ in cancers that responded well to treatment compared with those that did not.  CPC-GENE will also sequence multiple regions of prostate cancer from the same gland to determine if and how the genetic make-up of prostate cancer varies within an individual man’s prostate</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
