         <STUDY_TITLE>The Landscape of Genetic Alterations in Hepatocellular Carcinoma, 88 matched HCC tumour/normal pairs WGS belongs to ICGC LICA-CN project</STUDY_TITLE>
         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common malignancy of the liver. Genomic analysis is conducted to identify genetic alterations in driver genes which are all druggable targets for cancer therapy.
Whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) and the landscaple of somatic mutations in 88 paired samples from HCC patients including tumors and matched adjacent normal tissues using Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform were performed.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
