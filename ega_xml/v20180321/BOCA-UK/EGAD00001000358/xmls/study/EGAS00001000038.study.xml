         <STUDY_DESCRIPTION>Agilent whole exome hybridisation capture will be performed on genomic DNA derived from Chondrosarcoma cancer and matched normal DNA from the same patients. Next Generation sequencing will be performed on the resulting exome libraries and mapped to build 37 of the human reference genome to facilitate the identification of novel cancer genes</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>

         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>Cancer is driven by mutation. Using Agilent exome hybridisation capture and Illumina massively parallel sequencing technology, we aim to sequence microRNAs plus the protein coding genome of a number of matched human Chondrosarcoma samples. Bespoke algorithms are being developed to identify the somatically acquired point mutations, insertions and deletions in these samples. This project will give unprecedented insights into mutational processes, cellular repair pathways and gene networks associated with cancer development.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
