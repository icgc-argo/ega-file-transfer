         <STUDY_TITLE>Genomic Alterations in Gingivo-buccal Cancer: ICGC-India Project_YR01</STUDY_TITLE>
         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>As a part of the ICGC, India has undertaken genomic studies on gingivobuccal cancer of the oral cavity, which is the most prevalent form of cancer among men in India.   There are various known environmental (life-style) correlates of this cancer, the most important of which are tobacco chewing and HPV infection.  Paired DNA samples – isolated from the tumor tissue and from the blood of fifty patients – have been analyzed to catalog germline and somatic mutations. Association between each observed genomic alteration and exposure to environmental risk factors is being explored.

	Detailed clinical characterization of the patients, collection of data on demographic and environmental exposures, and isolation of DNA samples from blood and tumor tissues collected from each patient are being done at the Advanced Centre for Research, Treatment and Education on Cancer, Mumbai.  Exome capture and deep resequencing are being performed at the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani. We have analyzed the exomes of paired blood and tumor DNA samples using two orthogonal platforms – exome capture by Roche-Nimblegen SeqCap Ez kit followed by sequencing on Roche-454 GS FLX, and exome capture by Illumina TrueSeq Exome Enrichment kit followed by sequencing on Illumina HiSeq-2000. Each exome is being sequenced at a mean depth of 30x. In addition, we have used Illumina Omni Quad SNP-chips to generate genotype data at 1.14 million genomic markers. The average concordance between SNP-chip and sequence data is 99.8%.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
