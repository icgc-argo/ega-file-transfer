         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>This 2017_AML_WGS study includes 10 paired samples derived from Korean AML paitients.
10 AML Bone Marrow samples were collected and paired with each normal(Saliva or BM derived) sequencing data.
The results of this WGS study were analyzed by Mutect and GATK for ranking germline variants and cancer variants to make mutational profile matrix.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
