         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>2014 AML WES study contains 51 paired WES samples which were collected from SNUH. The study was designed to examine the molecular abnormalities from leukemic patients at initial diagnosis in comparison with corresponding germ line control (saliva samples). The results of WXS were analyzed by Mutect for ranking cancer variants and creating mutational matrix.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
