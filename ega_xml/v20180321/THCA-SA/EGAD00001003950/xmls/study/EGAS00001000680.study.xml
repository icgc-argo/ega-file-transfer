         <STUDY_TITLE>Molecular Signature of Saudi Thyroid Cancer Using whole exome sequencing</STUDY_TITLE>
         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>In Saudi Arabia, thyroid cancer ranked second only to breast cancer among females, eleventh among males and this increased incidence is prevalent in other Gulf Council Countries also. Differentiated thyroid cancer, which includes papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and follicular subtypes, accounts for 90% of all thyroid malignancies. Currently, there are no clinical or molecular diagnostic tools to predict recurrence and aggressiveness of a subset of PTC. With the goal of better understanding the pathobiology of thyroid carcinogenesis we will use Whole Exome Sequencing to decipher the molecular and genetic signature of Saudi PTC based on International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) Guidelines. The study will provide a better understanding of PTC and should have important clinical implications in the development of new and better strategies for targeted therapeutic intervention for the treatment of Saudi Arabian PTC</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
