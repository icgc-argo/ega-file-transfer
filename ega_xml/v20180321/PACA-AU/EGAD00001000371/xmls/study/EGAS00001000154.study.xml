         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>The purpose of the Australian ICGC Pancreatic Cancer Genome Sequencing Initiative
study is to identify the common driving mutations underlying the initiation and
development of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma in a large cohort of pancreatic cancer
patients (n=350). Matched genome sequences will be generated from normal tissue
(duodenum) and resected primary tumour tissue in each patient using exome and
whole genome sequencing. The complete repertoire of somatic mutations will be
determined (substitutions, indels, copy number changes and structural changes).
Where possible, matched transcriptome sequencing will also be carried out to
determine locus activity, which mutations are actively expressed and which
rearrangements give rise to gene-fusion transcripts.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
