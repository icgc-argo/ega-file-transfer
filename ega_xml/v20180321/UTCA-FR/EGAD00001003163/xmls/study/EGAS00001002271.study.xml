         <STUDY_TITLE>Integrative analysis of whole genome sequencing, RNA sequencing and methylome array of 20 carcinosarcomas.</STUDY_TITLE>
         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>Carcinosarcomas of the female genital tract, or GCS, are uncommon but clinically highly aggressive neoplasms with biphasic histology of carcinomatous (C) and sarcomatous (S) elements.  These tumors represent a unique model to study the genetic and phenotypic diversity of cancer cells and the link between cellular plasticity and resistance to therapy. The aim of ICGC GCS program is to genomically characterize C and S components of 20 tumors, from endometrium or ovary, through an integrative analysis of whole genome sequencing, RNA sequencing and methylome array.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
