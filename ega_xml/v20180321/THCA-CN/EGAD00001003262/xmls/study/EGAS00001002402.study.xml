         <STUDY_TITLE>Comprehensive investigation of genome architecture of papillary thyroid cancer with whole-exon sequencing in the Chinese population.</STUDY_TITLE>
         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>In this study, we performed whole-exon sequencing (WES) of 50 paired PTC tumors and adjacent normal tissues to identify novel potential biomarkers. We extracted mutational signatures which induce somatic mutations. Moreover, we observed copy number changes frequently occurring in some cancer related genes. Our study covers a comprehensive genetic framework that can be used in clinical trials and treatment modalities in PTC.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
