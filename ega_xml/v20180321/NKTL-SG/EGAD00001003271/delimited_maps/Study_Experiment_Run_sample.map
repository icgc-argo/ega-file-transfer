EGAS00001002398	Lymphomas are malignancies originating from the lymphatic system and there is a worldwide significant increase in incidences of this cancer. Lymphomas can be further classified into 2 categories namely Hodgkin’s (HL), and Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). The latter can be divided further into B, T and NK cell NHL. Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and Natural Killer/ T-cell lymphoma (NKTL) arise from mature T lymphocytes and NK cells. The more common subtypes include NKTL, PTCL not-otherwise-specified (PTCL-NOS), systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), follicular PTCL (F-PTCL), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL).

EGAS00001002398	Lymphomas are malignancies originating from the lymphatic system and there is a worldwide significant increase in incidences of this cancer. Lymphomas can be further classified into 2 categories namely Hodgkin’s (HL), and Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). The latter can be divided further into B, T and NK cell NHL. Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and Natural Killer/ T-cell lymphoma (NKTL) arise from mature T lymphocytes and NK cells. The more common subtypes include NKTL, PTCL not-otherwise-specified (PTCL-NOS), systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), follicular PTCL (F-PTCL), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL).

Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and Natural Killer/ T-cell lymphoma (NKTL) arise from mature T lymphocytes and NK cells. The more common subtypes include NKTL, PTCL not-otherwise-specified (PTCL-NOS), systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), follicular PTCL (F-PTCL), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL).

Lymphomas can be further classified into 2 categories namely Hodgkin’s (HL), and Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). The latter can be divided further into B, T and NK cell NHL. Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and Natural Killer/ T-cell lymphoma (NKTL) arise from mature T lymphocytes and NK cells. The more common subtypes include NKTL, PTCL not-otherwise-specified (PTCL-NOS), systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), follicular PTCL (F-PTCL), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL).

EGAS00001002398	Lymphomas are malignancies originating from the lymphatic system and there is a worldwide significant increase in incidences of this cancer. Lymphomas can be further classified into 2 categories namely Hodgkin’s (HL), and Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). The latter can be divided further into B, T and NK cell NHL. Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and Natural Killer/ T-cell lymphoma (NKTL) arise from mature T lymphocytes and NK cells.
