         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>The Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Genome Project aims to identify genetic alterations involved in the development and progression of the CLL, which are still unknown, with the objective of generating a comprehensive catalogue of genetic alterations in 500 independent tumours.    
               The CLL Genome Project, as a contributing member of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), has the purposes of creating diagnostic tools, discovering therapeutic targets and developing new strategies that will allow a customized therapy for CLL in order to make it more precise and effective.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
