         <STUDY_DESCRIPTION>Genomic libraries (500 bps) will be generated from  total genomic DNA derived from 40 breast cancer samples and subjected to total of eight lanes of 37 bp, paired end sequencing on the llumina GA. Paired reads will be mapped to build 37 of the human reference genome to facilitate the generation of genome wide copy number information, and the identification of novel rearranged cancer genes and gene fusions.</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>

         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>The majority of human cancer genes identified to date are somatically rearranged in the small minority of human cancers comprising leukemias, lymphomas and soft tissue tumors. However, conventional strategies for characterizing rearrangements are laborious, low-throughput and have low sensitivity/resolution, thus the role of genomic rearrangement in human breast cancer is unknown. We aim to use massively parallel paired end sequencing to explore the diversity of aberrant processes sculpting breast cancer genomes, and to identify novel rearranged cancer genes and gene fusions that may be future therapeutic targets.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
