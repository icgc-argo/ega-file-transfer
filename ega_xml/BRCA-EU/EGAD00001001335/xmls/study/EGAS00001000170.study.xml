         <STUDY_DESCRIPTION>We propose to definitively characterise the somatic genetics of 20 breast cancers through generation of comprehensive catalogues of somatic mutations by high coverage genome sequencing coupled with integrated transcriptomic data.</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>

         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>All cancers arise due to somatically acquired mutations in their genomes which alter the function of key cancer genes. Understanding the critical mutational events underlying the development of cancer is paramount for advancing prevention, early detection and effective treatment of the disease. Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death among women. Extraordinary recent advances in sequencing now make it a realistic aim to sequence large numbers of breast cancer genomes to find somatic mutations on a massive scale.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
