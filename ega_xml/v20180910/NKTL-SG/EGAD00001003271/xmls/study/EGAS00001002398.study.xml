         <STUDY_TITLE>Lymphomas are malignancies originating from the lymphatic system and there is a worldwide significant increase in incidences of this cancer. Lymphomas can be further classified into 2 categories namely Hodgkin’s (HL), and Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). The latter can be divided further into B, T and NK cell NHL. Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and Natural Killer/ T-cell lymphoma (NKTL) arise from mature T lymphocytes and NK cells. The more common subtypes include NKTL, PTCL not-otherwise-specified (PTCL-NOS), systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), follicular PTCL (F-PTCL), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL). 

Whole genome analyses on T-cell and NK-cell lymphoma samples from various countries to gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis and biology of these tumors. The comprehensive profiling and comparison among patients from various countries with different etiopathogenesis will hopefully facilitate the elucidation of key pathways and underlying molecular mechanisms driving these cancers, opening up novel therapeutic strategies in the future.</STUDY_TITLE>
