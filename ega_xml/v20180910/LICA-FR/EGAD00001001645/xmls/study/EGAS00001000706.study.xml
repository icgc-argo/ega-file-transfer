         <STUDY_ABSTRACT>The French ICGC project on liver tumors is coordinated by Pr Jessica Zucman-Rossi and funded by Inca (French Institute for Cancer).  The aim of the present project is to identify the catalog of somatic and germline mutations in liver tumors using whole genome and whole exome sequencing together with CGH-SNP, methylome and transcriptomic profiling. For this purpose, a series of 500 liver tumors are collected through the French National Liver Collection and these samples will be analyzed using the different omics technologies. The data will be deposited in the ICGC and EGA database to be publically available for the scientific community.  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for more than 90% of liver cancers, and is a major health problem. It is the 3rd cause of cancer-related mortality. Advances in genomic analyses have formed a comprehensive understanding of different underlying pathobiological layers resulting in hepatocarcinogenesis. Thus, the development of next-generation sequencing technologies has made it possible to generate more comprehensive catalogues of somatic alteration events (single nucleotide substitutions, structural variations, and epigenetic changes) in liver cancer genome than ever before. The dataset will include 50 whole genome sequencing tumor/germline pairs, of which 6 are deposited in February 2014.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
